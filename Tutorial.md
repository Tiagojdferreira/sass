If you want a boilerplate to start with, feel free to grab my small demo at:

Once you pull the app, feel free to open up index.html and see what it looks like. Once you're done and you're ready to start, change branches to 'step0' by doing:

    git checkout step0
   
In this branch you will have just the basic tools needed to complete this tutorial. Before you start changing your sass files (in the directory scss), run the command:

    gulp watch
    
This will automatically compile your scss files for you. If at some point the watch breaks down, just run the command again.
